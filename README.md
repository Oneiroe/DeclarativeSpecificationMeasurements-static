# Janus Declarative Specification Measurements
Static Repository for results and tests sharing of Janus declarative specifications measurement component. This archive contains the additional material to the paper "Measurement of Rule-based Linear Temporal Logic Specifications on Finite Traces".

Janus How-to
=========================
Janus is a tool-set for the evaluation of declarative process mining specifications ([LICENSE](https://github.com/Oneiroe/MINERful/blob/master/LICENSE) here).

It is based on Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces with past operators (LTLp~f~) and specifically on the concept  of reactive constraints: formulae with an explicit distinction between the activator and consequent factors of the formula itself.

For details on the usage of the software consult the [wiki page](https://github.com/Oneiroe/Janus/wiki)

Index
=========================
* **tool-executable**: java executable of our tool. It requires Java version 8-11 to be executed;
* **example**: Contains the complete and precise data used for the trailing example in the paper (Table.1):
    * **log.txt** event log from the example
	* **output[eventsEvaluation].csv**: events evaluation for each rule and specification. 
	* **output[logMeasures].csv** : measures for the log for a specification and all its rules.
	* **output[tracesMeasures].csv** : measures for each trace of the log for a specification and all its rules.
	* **output[tracesMeasuresStats].csv** : statistics fo the distribution of trace measures for the specification and its rules.
	* **specification.json** : set of rules of the specification.
* **experiment-1**: script required to reproduce the experiment-1:
    * **REAL-LIFE-MINERS-COMPARISON.sh**: BASH script to launch the experiment (UNIX only). It is required Java 8-11 and Python3 with pm4py package installed.
	! ATTENTION: please note that due to space limit we could upload A) all the data-set, B) the specification miners executable (MINERful, Janus, Perracotta). In order to reproduce the experiment those should be downloaded and placed as demanded by the launcher script
	* **LOG/dataset-references.txt**: references to the data-set for their download
* **experiment-1-results**: results for experiment 1 used in the paper (sepsis) and left out due to space (others).
    * **X-results**: measures for each specification discovered
	* **X-times**: for each specification discovered was saved the number of rules and the time required to compute its measures
* **experiment-2**: results for experiment 2
	* results for experiment 2 (the model was mined with Janus miner with a Confidence threshold of 1 and Support threshold of 0)


* **Sepsis dataset** :  the data used for our experiments, provided in CSV,XES, and a textual "PERRACOTTA-ready" one. 

General remarks
=========================
- the event evaluations files (e.g., output[eventsEvaluation].csv) use a byte-schema to encode the results:  0=00 (activation and target violated), 1=01 (activation violated and target satisfied), 2=10(activation satisfied and target violate), 3=11 (activation and target satisfied). The mapping with the paper event-evaluation is 3->1, 2->-1, 0,1->0
- the specifications are called MODEL in the results files for legacy reasons
- the specifications are described using the DECLARE language
